Description: In order to smoothly animate the transformation of polygons and  paths, many aspects needs to be taken into account, such as differing number  of control points, changing center of rotation, etc. The 'transformr'  package provides an extensive framework for manipulating the shapes of  polygons and paths and can be seen as the spatial brother to the 'tweenr'  package.
